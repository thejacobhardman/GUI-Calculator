# GUI-Calculator
### Welcome! 
This is a simple calculator program built using the Java Swing library with a few extra features.
I made this program for my final project in my CS200 course. I hope that you enjoy it!
I was limited for time so please feel free to maek any additions/changes that you'd like provided you follow the license guidelines.

### How To Run
The main way to run the program is by running the **'Calculator.Java'** file via a Java interpreter. Running the **'GUI.Java'** file will also work at least in Eclipse.
 
 ### Program Features
1. Dark/Light UI Themes.
2. Included Sound Effects (which can be toggled off).
3. Ability to export calculator history to an external .txt file.
4. Order Of Operations Aware Calculations
5. Keybinds

### How To Use Keybinds
I unfortunately didn't have the time to add true keystroke bindings. However, by holding down the **'alt'** key you can use your keyboard's numpad to input values to the calculator. The **'enter/return'** key will process the calculation. If you aren't holding down the **'alt'** key then the keybinds won't work.

### Troubleshooting
Make sure that the 3 audio files are placed in the same directory as the **'src'** folder. The same goes for this README file. Otherwise the program will not have access to them.
